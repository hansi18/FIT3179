          <h2>Fuel exports from Malaysia in 2021</h2>
          <p>Malaysia is a significant exporter of fuel, particularly petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
 The country's abundant oil and gas reserves have made it a key player in global energy markets.
 Crude oil, refined petroleum products, and LNG are among Malaysia's top fuel exports, with major export destinations including China, Japan, and South Korea.
 The fuel export sector is vital to Malaysia's economy, contributing substantially to national revenue and supporting the country's
 development as a regional energy hub.</p>

          <h2>Primary Production by Fuel Type</h2>
          <p>Malaysia's primary energy production is dominated by oil and natural gas, which account for the 
largest share of the country's fuel mix. Natural gas, in particular, plays a significant role due to Malaysia's abundant reserves, 
contributing to both domestic consumption and exports. Coal is also a key fuel type, primarily used in electricity generation,
while renewable energy sources like hydropower, solar, and biomass are gradually growing in importance as part of Malaysia's efforts
 to diversify its energy mix and promote sustainability. The government is increasingly focusing on expanding renewable energy 
capacity to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. </p>
