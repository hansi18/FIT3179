    <h1>OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN MALAYSIA</h1>
  </div>
  <div class='content'>
  <p >Malaysia, situated in Southeast Asia, plays a crucial role in the oil and gas industry, which is a major pillar of the nation's economy.
    The country began producing oil in the early 1900s from onshore fields in Sarawak and expanded into shallow-water plays in Peninsular Malaysia,
    Sarawak, and Sabah during the 1960s. Since then, Malaysia has ranked as the 4th largest oil producer in the Asia-Pacific region and the 2nd largest
    in Southeast Asia. According to Zvonimir Djerfi, President of the Asia-Pacific division, "Other locations in the Asia-Pacific region are not as
    central as Malaysia, and they either lack space or a capable workforce to meet the needs of the oil and gas services industry." Both short-term
    and long-term investments in Malaysia are likely to yield promising results.</p>

      <h3>Comparison of oil producing countries</h3>
      <p>Malaysia’s most valuable mineral resources are its reserves of petroleum and natural gas. Crude oil, refined petroleum, and, more recently,
        liquefied natural gas (LNG) together account for a major portion of the country’s commodity export earnings. Most of crude oil is produced
        in Sabah (42%), Peninsular malaysia (32%) and Sarawak (26%). These oil production helped Malaysia to stand at 4th place in oil producing countries 
        of Asia pacific region and 2nd in South east asia after Indonesia.
