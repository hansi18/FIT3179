    <h1>OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN MALAYSIA</h1>
  </div>
  <div class='content'>
  <p> Malaysia is a key player in Southeast Asia's oil industry,  
relying heavily on the sector as a major economic pillar.  
Oil production began in Sarawak in the early 1900s, expanding  
to Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and Sabah by the 1960s.  
Malaysia ranks 4th in oil production in the Asia-Pacific,  
and 2nd in Southeast Asia, solidifying its strategic importance.  
Zvonimir Djerfi, Asia-Pacific President, highlights Malaysia's unmatched role, citing  
its available space and skilled workforce for oil investments.  
Both short- and long-term investments show promising results here.</p>

    <div class='pure-u-1-2'>
      <h3>Comparison of oil producing countries</h3>
      <p>Malaysia’s key mineral resources are petroleum and natural gas reserves.  
Crude oil, refined petroleum, and LNG dominate the country’s export earnings.  
Most crude oil is produced in Sabah, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sarawak.  
This production ranks Malaysia 4th in the Asia Pacific region.  
Malaysia is 2nd in Southeast Asia, following Indonesia in oil output.   </p>

      <h3>Primary fuels produced in Malaysia</h3>
      <p>Malaysia is a major producer of crude oil and natural gas.  
It has two regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia, separated geographically.  
Oil reserves are found in remote areas, far from consumers.  
The energy market is divided into two sub-units accordingly.  
West Malaysia’s offshore platforms supply the domestic market's energy needs.  
East Malaysia's oil fields mainly export to the international market.

         <div class='pure-g'>    
      <h3>Fuel exports from Malaysia</h3>
      <p>Malaysia exports fuel, especially petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG).  
Its large oil and gas reserves make it globally significant in energy.  
Crude oil, refined petroleum, and LNG are Malaysia's top exports.  
Key export destinations include China, Japan, and South Korea mainly.  
The fuel export sector is crucial to Malaysia’s growing economy.  
It contributes significantly to national revenue and overall development efforts.  
Malaysia is developing as a regional energy hub within Southeast Asia.

      <h3>Economic Impact in Oil-Exporting Countries</h3>
      <p>Oil rents are vital in formulating the PGEB for oil exporters.  
Tax collection is still an essential source of government revenue.  
For oil exporters, tax revenue often plays the biggest role.  
To understand oil rents' effect, tax revenue must be considered.  
Malaysia and other oil-exporting nations depend on both sources.

    <div class='pure-g'>    
      <h3>Different types of fuel consumed</h3>
      <p>Malaysia relies almost equally on oil and natural gas to meet its energy needs. With a total energy demand of 1,164 TWh—about half that of France—91% of this demand is met by fossil fuels, specifically oil and natural gas. These energy sources significantly overshadow the contributions of renewable energy. In 2016, fossil fuels accounted for 95.4% of the country’s energy consumption, highlighting their dominance in Malaysia’s energy landscape.

      <h3>Oil consumed by different sectors</h3>
      <p>In Malaysia, fuel consumption varies across sectors with economic activities. Transportation consumes the most fuel, using petroleum for vehicles.
The industrial sector uses fuel for manufacturing and operations. Residential and commercial sectors rely on natural gas for cooking. Fuel consumption highlights Malaysia's dependence on fossil fuels today. </p>

      <h3>Comparison of CO2 Emissions of Different Countries</h3>
      <p>CO2 emissions in Malaysia mainly come from fossil fuel reliance. Oil and natural gas are primary sources for energy production. The industrial sector significantly contributes, especially manufacturing and palm oil. Transportation emissions rise with increasing vehicle ownership in Malaysia. Deforestation for agriculture, particularly palm oil, worsens carbon emissions. Efforts focus on renewable energy and improving energy efficiency.
